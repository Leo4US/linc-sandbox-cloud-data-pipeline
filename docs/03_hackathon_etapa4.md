# Stage 4 — Partner challenge and hands-on hackathon

This document details the fourth and final stage of the LINC Sandbox Cloud Data Pipeline: a partner-driven, hands-on hackathon focused on real-world data problems.

This stage represents the primary interface between the sandbox, external institutions and industry partners.

---

## Objective

The objective of Stage 4 is to:

- apply accumulated skills from previous stages
- expose students to realistic problem settings
- deliver tangible and reproducible outputs to partners
- strengthen institutional collaboration through controlled experimentation

---

## Participants

The hackathon involves:

- selected students from IFSP Campinas (TADS and postgraduate programs)
- faculty coordination and supervision
- coordinators from participating programs
- representatives from partner organizations (public or private)

---

## Partner engagement model

Partners may contribute through one of the following models:

1. public or open datasets with a concrete analytical problem  
2. anonymized datasets with defined scope and duration  
3. synthetic datasets mirroring real operational structures  
4. controlled access to partner environments (advanced cases only)

In all cases, data scope, usage limits and deliverables are agreed in advance.

---

## Hackathon format

Suggested format:

- duration: 1 full day or 2 half-days
- teams: 3–6 teams, 3–5 students per team
- supervision: continuous faculty presence
- environment: pre-approved and monitored cloud resources

---

## Deliverables

Each team is required to deliver:

1. a reproducible data pipeline (scripts or containers)
2. documented data validation and quality checks
3. an analytical output (report, dashboard or notebook)
4. a short partner-facing technical brief (1–2 pages)

All deliverables must be reproducible and auditable.

---

## Evaluation criteria

Projects are evaluated based on:

- technical correctness and reproducibility
- data quality and validation practices
- clarity of documentation
- relevance and usefulness to the partner
- responsible use of cloud resources

---

## Controls and safeguards (“Aquarium mode”)

To ensure safety and responsibility:

- all resources are provisioned with predefined limits
- execution windows are time-boxed
- no unsupervised workloads are allowed
- all resources are shut down immediately after the event

---

## Outcomes and visibility

After the hackathon:

- technical summaries are published via the LINC Sandbox LinkedIn Page
- validated artifacts remain in controlled repositories
- partners receive a consolidated technical package

This process ensures transparency, accountability and public visibility of results.

---

## Strategic value

Stage 4 consolidates the sandbox as:

- a practical learning environment
- a bridge between education and real-world problems
- a low-risk, high-value collaboration model for partners
