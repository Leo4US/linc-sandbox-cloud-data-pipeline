# Data protection, LGPD and ethical guidelines

This document outlines the data protection, privacy and ethical principles adopted in the LINC Sandbox Cloud Data Pipeline.

The project is designed to comply with Brazilian data protection law (LGPD) and general principles of responsible data use in educational and research contexts.

---

## Core principles

All activities within the sandbox follow these principles:

- legality and transparency
- purpose limitation
- data minimization
- security and access control
- accountability and traceability

Students and partners are informed of these principles before participation.

---

## Types of data used

The sandbox prioritizes the following data categories:

### Public and open datasets
- government open data
- publicly available datasets
- datasets with explicit open licenses

These datasets are preferred for stages 1 to 3.

### Anonymized datasets
- personal identifiers removed or masked
- no direct identification of individuals
- used only under defined scopes

### Synthetic datasets
- artificially generated data
- structure and logic similar to real datasets
- no real personal information

Synthetic data is preferred for partner challenges whenever possible.

---

## Partner-provided data

When partners provide data:

- scope and purpose are explicitly defined
- only minimum necessary data is shared
- access is restricted to authorized participants
- data is used only during the defined activity period

No data reuse outside the agreed scope is permitted.

---

## Access control and security

The following measures are applied:

- role-based access to datasets and resources
- temporary credentials where applicable
- separation between training and partner data
- immediate revocation of access after activities

---

## Data lifecycle management

- data ingestion is documented
- processing steps are logged
- outputs are reviewed before publication
- datasets are deleted or archived after use

No long-term storage of sensitive data is allowed.

---

## Ethical commitment

This sandbox is strictly educational and research-oriented.

- no surveillance use cases
- no profiling of individuals
- no discriminatory or harmful applications

All activities are supervised and aligned with institutional ethics and public-interest principles.
