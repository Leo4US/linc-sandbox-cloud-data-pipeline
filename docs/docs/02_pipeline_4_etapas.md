# The 4-stage sandbox pipeline

This document describes the operational structure of the LINC Sandbox Cloud Data Pipeline.

---

## Stage 1 — Theory and operational commands

Focus areas:

- data ingestion
- cleaning and normalization
- validation rules
- exploratory analysis
- reproducible scripts and notebooks

Expected outcome:

Students can execute basic data pipelines independently, with all steps documented and versioned.

---

## Stage 2 — Modeling and simulation (no cloud consumption)

Focus areas:

- architecture design
- pipeline orchestration logic
- cloud-like storage and service simulations
- containerized execution

Expected outcome:

Students understand cloud-based architectures without consuming cloud credits, and pipelines remain portable and reproducible.

---

## Stage 3 — Controlled execution (“Aquarium mode”)

Focus areas:

- limited-scope practical execution
- monitoring, logs and artifact generation
- explicit cost-awareness
- supervised review of outputs

Expected outcome:

Skills are validated under realistic constraints before engaging external partners.

---

## Stage 4 — Partner-driven challenge and hackathon

Focus areas:

- real-world problem statements
- teamwork under time constraints
- reproducibility and documentation
- partner-oriented deliverables

Expected outcome:

Functional prototype pipelines, technical reports or dashboards, and partner-facing briefs suitable for decision-making.

This stage represents the primary interface between the sandbox and external institutions.
