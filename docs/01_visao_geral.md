# Project overview — LINC Sandbox Cloud Data Pipeline

This project establishes a sandbox environment for applied training in data processing and analytics using cloud-oriented workflows.

The initiative is anchored at IFSP Campinas and coordinated within the LINC research and innovation group, integrating teaching, research and external engagement.

## Motivation

Current programs in computing and data science often emphasize theory or small-scale exercises. However, professional competence requires exposure to:

- realistic data structures and volumes
- end-to-end data pipelines
- operational constraints such as cost, performance and governance

Without access to cloud environments or realistic simulations, this gap persists.

## Proposed approach

The sandbox adopts a progressive model:

1. build operational foundations through hands-on activities
2. simulate cloud architectures locally, without cost
3. validate execution under supervision and strict guardrails
4. apply knowledge to real problems proposed by external partners

This model balances learning, safety and real-world relevance.

## Institutional relevance

The project:

- strengthens practical training at IFSP Campinas
- supports experimentation aligned with research activities
- creates a controlled channel for institutional partnerships
- increases visibility of validated educational and innovation outcomes

The sandbox model is auditable, scalable and transferable.
